Description:
	An Android application that displays a UI to the user.
	The user can enter credit card details into the UI.
	When a credit card's brand can be detected, it's logo is shown,
	and the card's details fields max length will match the cards parameters.
	When the user clicks the submit button, an algorithmic validation is done on,
	the card's number, and the result is displayed to the user. 
Usage:
	This Android project use the Gradle build system.
	The fastest method to build and run this project is to download Android Studio,
	and import the project.
Cards and Validations:
	New cards can be created as a CardType enum. A regex pattern is used to determine
	the card brand. The max length of the card number and cvv number, as well as a card logo
	can also be defined.
	To define the algorithm used for card validation, you can create a class that
	implements the validator interface and pass it to the enum.
UI:
	The UI consists of an edittext view that allows the user to enter a card number.
	There are also two spinner views that allow the user to enter the card's expiration date.
	An edittext view also allows the user to enter the cvv number of the card.
	There is a submit button that when clicked will do a validation on the card.
	As the user enters a card number, the brand is detected and the card's logo is shown.
	If the card is unknown, no checks will be run, except for the validation when the submit
	button is clicked.
Tests:
	There are currently two Android tests that test the brand of cards with known
	card numbers and their validations.
	Any future cards or validation algorithms should have tests created when added.
